I am a Research Fellow with the [Systems Biology Laboratory](http://uomsystemsbiology.github.io/ "Systems Biology Laboratory") at the {% marginfigure '../assets/img/taranaki.png' '[Where I grew up](https://goo.gl/svo7uo): Taranaki in New Zealand. About halfway between Toko and Whangamomona; out back of the Matemateaonga Ranges' %} University of Melbourne.  

My research focuses on developing [conceptual frameworks and computational tools]({{ site.url }}/articles/16/grammar-of-networks/), and [applying network modelling and analysis methods]({{ site.url }}/articles/16/applied-network-modelling/) to infer regulatory networks in biological systems with a general focus on cancer and other human diseases.  To do this, we use genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data, as well as literature analysis and text mining techniques.  

I am also interested in [research reproducibility]({{ site.url }}/articles/15/reproducible-research/): how we verify published results in the computational life sciences, and make sure they can be reproduced independent of time, space and environment.
