Danielâ€™s research focuses on the application of network and graph theory to infer gene regulatory networks with a general focus on cancer and other human diseases. This work is accomplished using both microarray and next-generation sequencing data for mRNA and miRNA gene expression. Daniel is also interested in developing improved methods of network structure and data visualisation.
